v1.4
added
    Ability to test Neural Net on new inputs
    New inputs seem generally correct for average movies
        new inputs are wildly inaccurate for exceptional movies
        Avatar should be a true 0, seems to think I would put it at 70s
        Paths of Glory is 100, seems to think I would put it at 70s
    It may be that my subjectivity is basically unpredictable

v1.3
added:
    Matlabplot to graph error rates
    added learning rate, had to try a bunch of different values before
        data behaved as expected.
    Project appears to function correctly. 

v1.2

added:
	Applies error functions to calculate errors
	adjust_weights function
	the main function runs 1 data item through the network once,
		adjusts the weights, runs the item through the network
		again, and reports the new output error. The error
		appears to be lower each time. Makes me think that the
		system works.

v1.1

Added:
	output_error function
	self.error to the neuron
	function to compute self.error for hidden layers
	solved a bug in the data where it was saving as strings and couldn't do math.
